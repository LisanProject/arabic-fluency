# Arabic Fluency Roadmap: A Structured Guide to B2 in 8 Months


**(c) 2025 Liban Hussein**

 **Ahlan**! This guide provides a detailed breakdown of the topics and vocabulary you’ll master to reach B2 proficiency—enabling fluency in complex discussions, media analysis, and professional contexts.

I remember the first time I tried to speak Arabic outside the mosque- my mind went completely blank. I could recite and undestand Qur'an, but asking friends about a sports match they watched or discussing events in Arabic?  Total disaster. For years, I've been stuck in this weird middle  ground - classical texts make sense, but casual conversations felt impossible to engage in. It's frustrating when your brain knows the language but your mouth refuses to cooperate.


**Here's the truth I've learned:**
Understanding Arabic and speaking it fluently are two completely different skills. And I've neglected the speaking part for too long. This guide is my public commitment to change that. No more hiding behind passive understanding. No more avoiding conversations. By **December ‘s end, 2025**, insha’Allah:

 **My goals are to:**

- Speak spontaneously without mental translation
- Conjugate verbs correctly in real-time conversations
- Discuss complex topics beyond just religion
- Translate short classical texts, including works and poems by Imām al-Shāfiʿī [[**Diwan al-Shāfiʿī**](https://www.noor-book.com/en/ebook-%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%8A-pdf)]
- Recite and understand portions of the Qur’an, ḥadīth, and duʿāʾ with insight into their grammar and rhetorical style
- Write short essays and reflections in Arabic on Islamic and cultural topics
- Participate in discussions and lessons conducted fully in Arabic
- Finally feel confident calling myself fluent — as a student of the language of the Qur’an

**This isn't about perfection. It's about bridging the gap between what I understand and what I can express. That's the mission of the Lisan Project.**
