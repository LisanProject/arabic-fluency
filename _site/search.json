    "text": "Arabic Fluency Roadmap: A Structured Guide to C1 in 8 Months\n(c) 2025 Liban Hussein\nAhlan! This guide provides a detailed breakdown of the topics and vocabulary you’ll master to reach C1 proficiency—enabling fluency in complex discussions, media analysis, and professional contexts.\nI remember the first time I tried to speak Arabic outside the mosque- my mind went completely blank. I could recite and undestand Qur’an, but asking friends about a sports match they watched or discussing events in Arabic? Total disaster. For years, I’ve been stuck in this weird middle ground - classical texts make sense, but casual conversations feel like running through quicksand. It’s frustrating when your brain knows the language but your mouth refuses to cooperate.\nHere’s the truth I’ve learned: Understanding Arabic and speaking it fluently are two completely different skills. And I’ve neglected the speaking part for too long. This guide is my public commitment to change that. No more hiding behind passive understanding. No more avoiding conversations. By December ’s end, 2025, insha’Allah:\nMy goals are to:\n\nSpeak spontaneously without mental translation\nConjugate verbs correctly in real-time conversations\nDiscuss complex topics beyond just religion\nTranslate short classical texts, including works and poems by Imām al-Shāfiʿī [Diwan al-Shāfiʿī]\nRecite and understand portions of the Qur’an, ḥadīth, and duʿāʾ with insight into their grammar and rhetorical style\nWrite short essays and reflections in Arabic on Islamic and cultural topics\nParticipate in discussions and lessons conducted fully in Arabic\nFinally feel confident calling myself fluent — as a student of the language of the Qur’an\n\nThis isn’t about perfection. It’s about bridging the gap between what I understand and what I can express. That’s the mission of the Lisan Project.\nWhat’s Inside the Lisan Project Roadmap:\n\nGrammar Foundations\n\nVerb conjugations (past/present/command), noun gender/plural rules, sentence structures.\n\nCore Vocabulary by Theme\n\nDaily life (family, work, travel), Islamic terms, media Arabic, and academic phrases.\n\nKey Skills per Level\n\nA1-A2: Basic dialogues, introductions, and high-frequency verbs.\nB1-B2: Complex sentences, opinions, and cultural nuances.\nC1 Mastery: Critiquing texts, understanding dialects in media, and formal writing.\n\nThematic Chapters\n\nHousehold items, professions, health, holidays, etc.—each with targeted word lists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote\n\n\n\n“العلم لا يُعطِيكَ بعضَهُ حتّى تُعطِيَهُ كلَّك، فإذا أعطَيتَهُ كلَّك، أعطاكَ بعضَهُ”\n“Knowledge will not give you part of itself until you give it all of yourself. And when you give it all of yourself, it will still only give you part of itself.”"
